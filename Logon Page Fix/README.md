#Login Page Fix

This is a fix to allow users with expired passwords to reset online.

##Setup

###1. Update the login.html file.

Add the **`login.html`** file to your project.

If you are using a repository, add this file to the **`/partials/controls`** directory.

If you are using file overrides, create a new file override named **`partials/controls/login.html`** and add this file as the content by following these steps:

 1. Edit your 2.0 site
 2. Go to “Code Editor” tab
 3. Hit “New File Override”
 4. Name this file `partials/controls/login.html`
 5. Place raw code in the section below. Save.
