Set up a custom user field configured as a file.
Assign the custom user field to the appropriate users.
Upload files to the custom user fields.
In either the Spec Form for an item or the js/controllers/specFormCtrl.js file override use this bit of code:

$scope.$watch('Variant', function(val) {
	//end the function if no Variant exists
	if (!val) return;
	//loop through user fields and set the desired variable spec file info
	angular.forEach($scope.user.CustomFields, function(field){
	    if(field.Label == "CUSTOMFIELDNAME"){
	        $scope.Variant.Specs.VARIABLEFILESPEC.File = field.File;
	        $scope.Variant.Specs.VARIABLEFILESPEC.Value = field.File.ID;
	    }
	});
});

It loops through all the available user fields, when it find the CUSTOMFIELDNAME that matches your custom user file field, then it will update the desired VARIABLEFILESPEC with it's required information.
